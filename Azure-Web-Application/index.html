                <h3>Decoding Cybersecurity - What's It All About?</h3>
                <h4>The CIA Triad</h4>
                <p>Cybersecurity encompasses a vast array of domains such as Information Security, Application Security, Physical
                    Security, Risk Assessment, Threat Intelligence, and more.  This industry can seem intimidating initially so
                    lets start by defining it; the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) defines cybersecurity as
                    the “art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice
                    of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.”  To better understand, lets focus
                    on that last part; “confidentiality, integrity and availability,” together they make up the CIA Triad which
                    is an important concept in cyber that highlights the three cornerstones of information security.
                    Confidentiality is all about privacy and focuses on “ensuring sensitive information does not reach unauthorized
                    people.”  Integrity is about authenticity and concentrates on “protecting information from being modified by
                    unauthorized people.”  Availability refers to “the quality of being able to be used or obtained” and the focal
                    point of which is to ensure the accessibility and redundancy of resources.  These three concepts are applied
                    in unison to establish methodologies that are dynamic, proficient, and effective in satisfying current
                    cybersecurity needs and anticipating those of the future.  Believe it or not, the CIA Triad most likely has
                    an impact on you every day and the fact that you’re reading this blog right now is just one example.  Due to
                    the ubiquitous nature of technology today, it’s important to be able to identify potential threats and
                    understand how to protect yourself from them.  Some examples include exercising caution with unexpected
                    emails & recognizing the indications of phishing attacks, using strong passwords & multi-factor
                    authentication, and installing antivirus software & ensuring your software is up to date.  We’ll learn more
                    about identifying cyberattacks and how to protect yourself in future posts, but keep in mind that it’s always
                    good to do your own research and I encourage you to do so, stay safe!<br>

                <h3>It's A Trap! - Recognizing Phishing Attacks</h3>
                <h4>Phishing Emails, Social Engineering, & Personal Identifying Information (PII)</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the most common types of attack in cyber is Phishing which is defined as “a fraudulent practice in which
                    an attacker masquerades as a reputable entity or person in an email or other form of communication.”  The Federal
                    Trade Commission (FTC) characterizes it as a kind of online scam that targets potential victims by sending emails
                    requesting personal identifying information (PII) that seem as if they are from a familiar source, in other words
                    a type of social engineering.  This stolen information is then used to enter the victim’s existing accounts or
                    potentially open new ones.  Now that we understand what Phishing is, lets dive in to how to protect yourself from
                    this type of attack.  A solid place to start is recognition, in other words being aware of the indicators of a
                    potential Phishing email.  Phishing emails often create a narrative to fool the victim into opening an attachment
                    or clicking a link, common themes of these made-up stories are suspicious account activity, account issues,
                    personal information confirmation, unfamiliar invoices, payments, and more, these tricksters are very creative!
                    Additionally, these emails will also have other common characteristics such as generic greetings, accounts
                    supposedly on hold due to billing issues, or invitations to update payment details via included link.  The FTC
                    provides four methods of protection from Phishing which are installing security software on your computer,
                    changing your cell phones settings to update software automatically, utilizing multi-factor authentication on
                    accounts, and backing up your data.  In the case that you have fallen victim to this type of scam and your
                    personal information has been stolen you should update your devices security software and run a scan then remove
                    anything that has been identified as a problem.  Additionally, you can report encountered phishing attempts to
                    the FTC at <u>ReportFraud.ftc.gov</u>.  In conclusion, knowledge is one of your greatest assets so you should adopt
                    a learning mindset in order to keep yourself protected because scammers are constantly coming up with new ways to
                    fool you!<br>
